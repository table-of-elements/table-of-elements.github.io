The focus of claims is not on enforcing issues that have already been contractually agreed upon, but on claims that go beyond that, such as deviations from the plan or defects. Claim management ensures that all contractual agreements are met and provides a structured approach to resolving disputes and minimizing financial risk."

# Claim Management

The claims management process involves the identification, evaluation and negotiation of claims in project management. The focus of claims is not on enforcing issues that have already been contractually agreed upon, but on claims that go beyond that, such as deviations from the plan or defects. Claim management ensures that all contractual agreements are met and provides a structured approach to resolving disputes and minimizing financial risk.
